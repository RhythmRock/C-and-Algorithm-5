# 10 C Language Projects (Last LVL)

This project includes the code for fundamental algorithmic problems that I created when starting out in software development and the C language. The codes consist of 10 different problems arranged from easy to difficult, which helps improve software skills from basic to complex. The codes in the project not only assist in enhancing basic C programming skills but also foster algorithmic thinking. This way, programming skills and problem-solving abilities are developed step by step, enabling a more competent entry into the world of software.

The fundamental algorithmic problems included in this project provide an opportunity to improve software skills by solving them step by step. By examining these codes, you can learn the basic structures of the C language and algorithm design. Additionally, by developing problem-solving abilities and algorithmic thinking, you can enhance your intellectual capacity.

In conclusion, the code for fundamental algorithmic problems included in this project is ideal for improving programming skills and algorithmic thinking when entering the world of software. By solving problems step by step, it enhances mastery of the basic C language and enables approaching more complex software projects with increased confidence.

## Lessons Learned

While building this project, I had the opportunity to enhance my fundamental skills in the C programming language. I encountered various challenges, but I learned to solve them using debugging techniques and step-by-step approaches. I also discovered the importance of organizing code in a modular way and communicating between functions. Throughout this project, I improved myself by facing these challenges, practicing and using external resources.

I strengthened my fundamental skills in the C programming language and enhanced my problem-solving abilities in this project. I adopted a patient and systematic approach to overcome challenges encountered during the debugging process. Additionally, I applied modular programming principles to make the code more sustainable and readable. By practicing documentation and commenting in this project, I increased the comprehensibility of the code and facilitated collaboration. These experiences significantly improved my programming skills and intellectual capacity.

In summary, by developing my fundamental skills in the C programming language through this project, I made a stronger start in the world of software. I made efforts to overcome challenges encountered and adopted a solution-oriented approach step by step. Through the codes and algorithms provided in this project, I increased my intellectual capacity and advanced my problem-solving skills. The experiences gained from this project helped me approach more complex projects in the future with increased confidence.

## Features

- Reversing an Array Using Recursion: This project involves reversing an array using recursion, where the order of elements is reversed.

- Finding the Largest of Three Numbers with Pointers: The project finds the largest number among three given numbers using pointers to access and compare the values.

- Swapping Two Numbers Using Pointers: In this project, two numbers are swapped using pointers to modify their values in memory.

- Printing an Array Using Pointers: The project prints the elements of an array using pointers to access and display the array's content.

- Vowels and Consonants in a String Using Pointers: This project identifies and counts the number of vowels and consonants in a string using pointers to traverse the characters.

- Bubble Sort: The project sorts an array using the Bubble Sort algorithm, where adjacent elements are compared and swapped if necessary to arrange them in order.

- Insertion Sort: In this project, the Insertion Sort algorithm is used to sort an array by inserting elements into their correct positions within a sorted subarray.

- Selection Sort: The project sorts an array using the Selection Sort algorithm, which repeatedly selects the minimum element and places it in the correct position.

- Quicksort: This project implements the Quicksort algorithm to efficiently sort an array by partitioning and recursively sorting its subarrays.

- Program to Read the First Line from a File: The project reads the first line from a file and performs an operation based on the content of that line.
